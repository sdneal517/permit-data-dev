The objective of the work is to consolidate receptacles and lighting onto their own dedicated circuits for an unfinished basement and utility room. Currently, the basement contains receptacles and lighting that are on various circuits. Altercations to existing circuitry will be required but limited to the additions of electrical junction boxes to reestablish disturbed connections. The project aims to improve safety, functionality, and energy efficiency in compliance with codes and regulations. The basement will continue to stay in an “unfinished” state after the work is completed as there are no future projects planned. Unfinished Basement Work:Add additional basement receptacles that are protected from a new 20A GFCI/AFCI combination breaker utilizing 12/2 cable. Add dimmable light fixtures from a new 15A AFCI breaker utilizing 14/2 cable. The unfinished utility room lighting will also be on the same circuit.  Unfinished Utility (Laundry) Room Work:Washer and dryer (gas) are currently fed from a single 15A circuit and are not GFCI protected. Washer and Dryer circuit to be upgraded to a 20A circuit protected form a new 20A GFCI/AFCI combination breaker. Currently, circuits 8 and 14 are on a multiwire circuit utilizing 10/3 cable. The 10/3 cable is to be re-used for the new washer and dryer circuit in case the dryer requires a 30A 240V circuit in the future. A separate circuit will be dedicated for the other receptacles in the laundry room that will be fed from a new 20A GFCI/AFCI combination breaker utilizing 12/2 cable."
