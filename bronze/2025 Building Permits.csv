This includes adding (2) ground rods outside, a main ground to water meter and a bond at hot water tank. There is currently a cabinet around main panel, this will need to be removed. We will replace junction box above washing machine, run new MC down to washer, install new box and GFCI. Then, we will replace bell box outside on garage, install new WR GFCI with bubble cover. Once this is done, and power is restored to circuit, if it keeps tripping or malfunctioning, then the issue is most likely underground and additional estimates will be needed. "
